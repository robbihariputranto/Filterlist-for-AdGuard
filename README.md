## About ℹ

This is a very aggressive filter-list that consolidates over __340 lists__ for use in
AdGuard Home (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardHome).

* It includes AdGuard's official **AdGuardSDNSFilter**
* It is cleaned, sorted, with duplicates removed

### Latest News (March 28th, 2021)

* __2.58__ Released on March 28th, 2021
* Please check that you've added a third and fourth part of the blocklist to AdGuard Home as per the
[usage page](https://github.com/hl2guide/Filterlist-for-AdGuard/blob/master/USAGE.md).
* Please note that 2.60 is in development
* 2.60 has been delayed until I work out the approach I'd like to take to reduce filesize

### VITAL NOTES 👀

* Please learn AdGuard Home's interface before using this list
* The blocklist is very aggressive so before using this list please ensure that you add your own
"Custom filtering rules" for domains you want to allow
e.g: `@@||nexusmods.com^$important`
* Since everyone uses the internet differently please be aware that some initial
manual whitelisting is required
* The blocklist is around 120MB so if you're internet plan is data limited please account for
about 3000MB (3GB) per month, if AdGuard Home is set to update once per day
* The blocklist is not "set and forget"
* The blocklist is more cleaned up, optimized and better than ever
* The blocklist now purely contains only domains and IP addresses (as of v2.57)

### What it Blocks 👁‍

* botnets, crypto-lockers and data miners
* drug sales, enrichments and fake sites
* fake news, invasive telemetry and phishing sites
