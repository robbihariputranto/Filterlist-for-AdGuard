# Usage

Check that you are using __AdGuard Home v0.105.2__ or later
(vital functionality was hotfixed).

## DNS Settings within AdGuard

I personally use and recommend people consider using Quad9 (https://www.quad9.net/) as their DNS.

Quad9 tops the speed and reliaility tests for my location; they offer Malware Blocking, support DNS-over-TLS and also DNSSEC.

They are also now "incorporated in Switzerland to guarantee privacy for global DNS users" (quad9).

* _(optional)_ To test it at your location run the tool: [GRC Domain Name Speed Benchmark for Windows/Linux](https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm)

### Upstream DNS servers

tls://dns.quad9.net

### Bootstrap DNS servers

9.9.9.9

### DNS server configuration

Check/tick the "Enable DNSSEC" checkbox and click the green __Save__ button.

## Lists 📓

Once you have __AdGuard Home__ ready and are logged in, use its main menu to add
multiple __blocklists__ and one __allowlist__ (below).

## Filters Update Interval ⏱

You can modify how often filter lists are updated within Adguard Home in the
__Settings__ > __General Settings__ page.

Set "Filters update interval" to 12 hours _(recommended)_ and click the green "Save" button.
This list updates around twice per day.
